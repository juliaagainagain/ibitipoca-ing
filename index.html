      <h2>What’s the Story Behind Ibitipoca? </h2>
      <img src="img/fazer.jpeg" alt="View from Janela do Céu in Ibitipoca State Park" style="width:100%; max-height:400px; object-fit:cover; border-radius:8px; margin: 1em 0;" />
      <p>
        Founded in the late 19th century (1891), Conceição de Ibitipoca has roots in the gold-mining era of Minas Gerais. 
        Its name derives from the indigenous Tupi-Guarani language meaning "burst mountain" or "split mountain." 
        Along the old 18th-century gold-smuggling routes, the village evolved from a mining waypoint into a peaceful rural community. 
        Visitors can still admire 17th- and 18th-century churches, such as the Church of Nossa Senhora da Conceição, reflecting the village's colonial heritage.

      <h2>Extra tips for Travelers</h2>
      <ul>
       The best time to visit Ibitipoca State Park is during the dry and cool winter months, from June to August. The rainy season runs from November to January and can make some trails more challenging. It's essential to purchase entrance tickets in advance, as the park limits the number of daily visitors. To make the most of your trip, bring sturdy hiking shoes, a headlamp (especially useful on the Pico do Pião trail), a reusable water bottle, and eco-friendly sunscreen. Accommodation options vary, from rustic campsites and countryside lodges to more modern inns in the village. For a truly immersive experience, take the time to engage with the warm local community and, if possible, arrange for homemade meals – a delicious way to connect with the region’s culture and hospitality.
